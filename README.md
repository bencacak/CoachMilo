### `!pace`
- The `!pace` command will convert a given pace from xx:xx min/mi to min/km and vice versa.
- *Syntax:* `!pace DD:HH:MM:SS <mi/km>`
  - The day and the hour fields can, and probably should be left empty--unless you are a snail.
  - *Example:* `!pace 10:51 mi`


    Input:
    !pace 10:51 mi

    Output:
    @user, a 10:51 mi is equal to a 00:06:41 km.
